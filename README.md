# Development of an Electronic Paper Display E-Reader

## Introduction

This E-Reader device is a Raspberry Pi 2 single board computer with the first generation MpicoSys 7.4” E-Paper Display Kit by Pervasive Displays, Inc. The kit provided included a timing control module(TCM) that was used to control the display and an Aurora SW074AS182 7.4” EPD. In this prototype, the device takes around 6 seconds to refresh the display because the EPD in use does not have a flashless update capability.

To run properly, there must be a Book directory within the project folder which contains EPUB files and the userAccounts.db must have indexed those ebooks with their corresponding users.
